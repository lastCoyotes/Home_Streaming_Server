# Home_Streaming_Server
Proof of concept of a Smart TV without the need for a Smart TV. Made this years ago during my 2021 CS Linux/UNIX course.

I don't have a lot of photos/videos that I want to have visible accross my network. Essentially,
I wanted this media server to function as a custom implementation of a smart tv, without using an actual
smart tv. As a result, this application contains a bunch of setup scripts to configure an ubuntu environment
to have a bunch of helpful links to popular streaming services or social media posts.

# Pre-Requisites:

Before you can run this application, you will want to have the following things installed:

Required:

- A system running Ubuntu with Gnome as your desktop environment
- Unified Remote Server (Used for controlling the server from your phone).

Suggested:

- SSH (Really helpful if you ever need to debug things, as that can be tough with Unified Remote)

# Future of this project.

The core features of this project are currently still being implemented.

- Links to and desktop shortcuts for popular streaming services:
  - Spotify
  - Hulu
  - Netflix
  - Youtube
  - HBO Max
  - Paramount+
 
  - TikTok
  - Instagram

- Send it a URL and it will instantiate a browser or desktop application to view the media sent to the server.
